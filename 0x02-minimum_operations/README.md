This is the third of alx-interview assessment named 0x02. Minimum Operations.

The problem is commonly known as the "Minimum Operations to Get n H" or "2 Keys Keyboard" problem. It's a well-known problem in dynamic programming.

We have a text file that initially contains a single character 'H', and the text editor can perform two operations:

Copy All: We can copy all the characters in the file.
Paste: We can paste the characters you copied.
The goal is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to have exactly n 'H' characters in the file. You start with one 'H', and you can use the copy and paste operations to create more 'H' characters.

Here's an example of how it might work for n = 9:

Initially, you have one 'H' in the file.
You can copy it, making it 'HH'.
You can then paste it, making it 'HHH'.
You can copy the 'HH' to have 'HHHH', and then paste it to have 'HHHHH'.
You can copy 'HHHH' and paste it to have 'HHHHHH'.
You can copy 'HHHHHH' and paste it to have 'HHHHHHH'.
Finally, you can copy 'HHHHHHH' and paste it to have 'HHHHHHHHH'.
In this example, it took seven operations to get exactly nine 'H' characters in the file.

To solve this problem, dynamic programming is often used to find the minimum number of operations. You would create a table or an array where each element represents the minimum number of operations required to have 'i' 'H' characters in the file. You would then fill in this table using a dynamic programming approach.

The "minimum operation" in this context refers to finding the minimum number of copy and paste operations needed to achieve the desired number of 'H' characters in the file. The dynamic programming approach ensures that you find the minimum number of operations efficiently.
